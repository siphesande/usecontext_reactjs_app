# Getting Started with Create React App


> React, useContext, Material-ui app 

## Quick Start
Run app using npm
```
# On the terminal
git clone https://github.com/siphesande/usecontext_reactjs_app$.git
cd usecontext_reactjs_app$
npm install 

# Run on http://localhost:3000
npm start 


# To create a production build
npm run build
 
```
 OR run the APP using yarn
```
yarn install
yarn start
yarn build
```
I decided to only use Javascript and context API because this App is very small and simple.
context API doesn't require any third-party libraries
Using a third-party library like redux  is an overkill. 
Using typescript is also an overkill.
