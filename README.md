> React, useContext, Material-ui app 

# Quick Start
Run app using npm
```
# On the terminal
git clone https://github.com/siphesande/usecontext_reactjs_app.git
cd usecontext_reactjs_app
npm install 

# Run on http://localhost:3000
npm start 

# To create a production build
npm run build
```
 OR run the app using yarn
```
yarn install
yarn start

# To create a production build
yarn build
```
- I decided to only use Javascript and context API because this App is very small and simple.
  Context API doesn't require any third-party libraries.
- Using a third-party library like redux is an overkill. 
- Using typescript is also an overkill. 
- That's why I'm not using typescript and redux.
